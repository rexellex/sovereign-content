# Digital Sovereignty

Digital sovereignty is the practice of maintaining complete control over your digital presence, assets, and infrastructure across five key domains. 

In an age where our lives seamlessly flow between physical and digital realms, this sovereignty isn't luxury—it's necessity. **Just as you wouldn't allow strangers to wander through your kitchen during family breakfast**, your digital life deserves equal protection.

As we inhabit online spaces for both work and leisure, the freedom to remain unmonitored by third-party actors becomes our fundamental right. True digital sovereignty empowers you to navigate the digital landscape on your own terms—free from unwanted tracking, surveillance, and exploitation.

These five domains include:

1. **Financial Sovereignty**: Self-custody of digital assets and financial autonomy
2. **Data Sovereignty**: Control over personal data through self-hosted solutions
3. **Communication Sovereignty**: Private, censorship-resistant communication channels
4. **Computational Sovereignty**: Independence through personal computing infrastructure
5. **Material Sovereignty, additional level**: Physical independence through circular construction principles

## Why Digital Sovereignty Matters

In an increasingly centralized digital landscape, personal autonomy has become an endangered concept. Large corporations and institutions control our financial transactions, host our data, mediate our communications, provide our computational resources, and dictate the lifecycle of our physical technologies.

This framework presents a comprehensive approach to reclaiming agency in your digital life, based on academic research and practical implementation strategies.
