# Computational Sovereignty

Computational sovereignty focuses on maintaining control over the computing resources that power your digital life, from running personal nodes to deploying open-source AI alternatives.

## Core Principles

1. **Infrastructure Ownership**: Control the hardware and infrastructure that powers your digital world. From modest home servers to full-stack setups or community-run compute clusters, true sovereignty starts with owning the physical and virtual machines.
2. **Network Participation**: Actively support decentralized protocols by running nodes, relays, and validators. Whether you're helping power the Bitcoin network, serving Nostr content, or hosting your own Matrix instance—participation is power.
3. **Local-first and Edge Computing**: Process data where it’s generated—on local devices or within trusted local networks. This boosts privacy, reduces reliance on cloud latency, and ensures services keep running even when offline.
4. **Sovereign Intelligence (AI & Automation)**: Run your own AI models, automations, and digital assistants. Use open-weight large language models (LLMs), fine-tune them for your needs, and deploy them privately—on your own GPUs, CPUs, or community shared hardware.
5. **Open-Source Foundations**: Use transparent, auditable software. Whether it's your OS, your LLM, or your web server, open-source ensures there are no secrets in the stack—and no invisible gatekeepers.
6. **Scalable Resource Efficiency**: Build with sustainability in mind: reuse hardware, right-size deployments, and design for energy awareness. Whether it's a solar-powered mesh node or a recycled GPU rig, efficiency is part of the ethos.

## Key Components

### Personal Node Operation

#### Benefits: 
  - Full control over validation, data, and uptime
  - Contribution to network health and censorship resistance
  - Independence from centralized APIs or services

#### Types of Nodes:
  - Bitcoin or Lightning nodes (for financial sovereignty)
  - Nostr relays, Matrix homeservers, IPFS gateways
  - Fediverse nodes (like Mastodon or PeerTube)

#### Self-hosted web and DNS servers
  - Hardware Considerations:
  - Raspberry, UDOO, Intel NUC, or mini PCs work well for low to mid-power nodes. For heavy loads: x86 servers with ECC RAM and SSDs.

#### Maintenance & Security:
  - Hardened Linux OS, firewall rules, automatic updates (with testing), and encrypted backups. Monitor logs and keep attack surfaces minimal.

### Open-Source AI Implementation
#### Local AI Models vs. Cloud:
  - Run models on your own hardware with no data leakage. Tools like Ollama, LM Studio, or Text Generation WebUI make it doable even on consumer-grade hardware.

#### Setup & Usage:
  - Install Ollama for easy LLM deployment (Mistral, LLaMA, etc.)
  - Use quantized models (GGUF) for lighter resource use
  - Integrate into workflows: offline assistants, document search, custom tools

#### Privacy Implications:
  - Nothing leaves your machine. Great for journaling, private brainstorming, or secure research.

### Home Mining Considerations

#### Economic & Network Contributions: 
  - Small-scale mining helps secure networks like Bitcoin. Or mine altcoins with practical utility (like Monero for CPU mining).
  - Hardware Selection:
        ASICs: High efficiency, Bitcoin only, loud and hot
        GPUs: More flexible, supports many coins, multipurpose
        CPUs: Great for privacy coins like Monero or for running AI/containers when idle

  - Energy Use & Sustainability:
        Pair mining with off-grid solar or repurpose heat output (yes, mining as a home heater is a real thing).

  - Infrastructure Integration:
        Run your miner in winter months to warm a room. Tie it into a smart home system for energy balancing.
