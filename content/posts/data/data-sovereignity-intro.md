# Data Sovereignty

Data sovereignty is all about taking back control‚Äîwhether as an individual or an organization. In a world where centralized platforms treat your information like a commodity, data sovereignty flips the script. It‚Äôs the practice of managing, storing, and securing your data on your terms using self-hosted, privacy-first tools that minimize external dependencies.
No data brokers. No surprise policy changes. Just your stuff, under your control.

## Core Principles

1. **Data ownership**: You own your data. Full stop. This means storing it on devices you control and using tools that don‚Äôt phone home to Big Tech.
2. **Access control**: ou decide who sees or interacts with your data‚Äîthrough encryption, permissions, or strict local access.
3. **Portability**: Your data should be easy to export, migrate, or back up, with no lock-in to proprietary ecosystems.
4. **Longevity**: Even if a service shuts down or a tool becomes unsupported, your data remains accessible and usable. This is why open formats matter.
5. **Privacy by design**: Build with privacy from the ground up: minimize exposure, use end-to-end encryption, and reduce data collection wherever possible.

## Self-Hosting Fundamentals

### Conceptual Overview
- Why traditional cloud services compromise sovereignty - Services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or iCloud are convenient‚Äîbut they centralize control, data access, and surveillance potential. They often encrypt your data for you, but hold the keys themselves.
- How self-hosting restores control - Hosting on your own hardware (home server, VPS, etc.) gives you root-level control. You choose how it‚Äôs stored, secured, and accessed.
- Balancing convenience with sovereignty - Yes, it can be more work up front. But you trade convenience for transparency, durability, and actual autonomy. Many tools today offer user-friendly dashboards to ease that burden.
- Progressive implementation approaches - You don‚Äôt have to go full bunker-mode on day one. Start with one service (like Nextcloud), get comfortable, then expand‚Äîpasswords, contacts, media, email, etc.

### Technical Foundations
- Home server options - Raspberry Pi, Intel NUC, old laptops, or full-blown server racks. Depends on your power needs, uptime expectations, and budget.
- Network considerations - Dynamic DNS, port forwarding, reverse proxies (like Nginx), and secure HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt.
- Backup strategies - 3-2-1 Rule: 3 copies, 2 different media, 1 offsite. Borg, Restic, or Duplicati with encrypted cloud or physical backups.
- Security principles - Harden your server (firewalls, fail2ban, SSH keys), keep software updated, and always use encrypted connections.
- Open-Source Operating Systems - Debian, Ubuntu Server, Alpine for lightweight builds. On mobile: GrapheneOS (Android), LineageOS, or /e/OS for de-Googled experiences.

## Implementation Guide

### For Individuals

#### Personal Cloud Storage: Nextcloud, Seafile, or Syncthing for file sync and sharing.

#### Calendar & Contacts Sync: Nextcloud + DAVx5 (Android) or EteSync for encrypted syncing.

#### Password Management: Self-hosted Bitwarden via Vaultwarden, or KeePass + cloud sync with strong encryption.

#### Email Self-Hosting: Advanced but possible. Use Mailcow, Mail-in-a-Box, or Maddy. Consider MX route hardening and spam resilience.

#### Media Servers: Jellyfin (open-source Plex alternative), Navidrome (music streaming), and Audiobookshelf for audiobook lovers.

#### Open-Source OS for Personal Devices: 
    Desktop: Ubuntu, Debian, Pop!_OS, or Fedora.
    Mobile: GrapheneOS (Pixel), LineageOS (wide support), or /e/OS (de-Googled Android).

#### Home Automation: Home Assistant for smart home management, with MQTT for sensor integration and local-first control.


üõ°Ô∏è Plus Features
#### Redundancy & High Availability: Use RAID (for local redundancy), rsync + cron jobs for scheduled mirroring, and optionally distribute backups across trusted nodes (like with Tailscale or ZeroTier).

#### Cross-Device Synchronization: Keep all your devices in sync using Nextcloud or Syncthing, encrypted vaults for key data, and WebDAV/CALDAV support for apps.
