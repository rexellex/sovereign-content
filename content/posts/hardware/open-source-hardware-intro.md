One of the comments on my last post nailed it: "𝘐𝘵'𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘴𝘰𝘧𝘵𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘦 𝘪𝘧 𝘪𝘵'𝘴 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘰𝘯 𝘺𝘰𝘶𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘦."

That one line cuts to the core of digital sovereignty—and raises a deeper question: 𝐰𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐦𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐝𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐬?

The divide between software and hardware sovereignty is stark:
𝘚𝘰𝘧𝘵𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘦: Open-source code can be audited, modified, and rebuilt. Users—or communities—can verify, patch, or fork it when needed. Transparency is built in.
𝘏𝘢𝘳𝘥𝘸𝘢𝘳𝘦: Most chip designs are proprietary. Few vendors publish schematics or RTL designs. We rely on supply chains and opaque silicon we can't inspect or verify.

This gap grows wider when things break:
Software bugs can be fixed with an update.
Hardware flaws often require a full redesign—if they’re even disclosed.

Software enables reproducible builds, peer review, and independent validation. Hardware? Much harder.
Even when CPU designs are open (e.g., HDL cores), there’s no easy way to prove the physical chip matches the source. And hardware backdoors or defects can slip through undetected—even in open designs.


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐚𝐭𝐡 𝐅𝐨𝐫𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝

Total control may be unattainable—but we can build resilient, layered systems:

▪️Use hardware with open firmware (e.g., Coreboot)
▪️Support open hardware efforts: RISC-V, MNT Reform, Talos II
▪️Reduce reliance on black-box components (e.g., disable Intel ME if possible)
▪️Choose platforms with strong community documentation

Pairing open software with the most verifiable hardware available minimizes risks and creates fail-safes when trust breaks down.

This isn’t just a personal challenge—it's a societal one.
Communities, including entire nations, need to act. Just as Switzerland promotes open-source software to strengthen autonomy and resilience, we must extend the same incentives to open hardware.
Public funding, procurement policies, and research support can accelerate open hardware adoption—and reduce dependence on opaque, foreign-controlled tech stacks.


𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐂𝐨𝐦𝐩𝐥𝐞𝐭𝐞 𝐏𝐢𝐜𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞

True digital sovereignty rests not just in source code, but in silicon.
If we want systems we can trust, we need both open software and open hardware. The latter is harder to build, but just as essential.
